This is to mention that the actual read_me file for this directory is ReadMe
taken from the actual catalogue site 'https://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/cats/J/A+A/594/A27/' for reference.

The table 'matched_sources_with_serial.fits' contains all the sources in 
the psz2.dat.txt that are classified true by our trained classifier. But most of
them may not contain diffuse emission as just halos. The format of this table file is 
exactly same as the psz2.dat.txt. So refer ReadMe.txt for understanding which column correponds
what.
